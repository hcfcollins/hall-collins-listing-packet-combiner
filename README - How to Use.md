4. If the `.command` file doesn't work, try right-clicking it and selecting "Open"

**Common Questions:**
- **Q: Why does a Terminal window open?** A: This is normal! The `.command` file uses Terminal to run Python. The app window will appear after a moment.
- **Q: The Terminal window shows text/errors** A: This is normal debugging information. You can ignore it as long as the app window opens.
- **Q: Can I close the Terminal window?** A: Yes, but it will also close the app. Keep it open while using the app.
- **Q: Nothing happens when I double-click** A: Try right-clicking the `.command` file and selecting "Open", or run the setup script first.
2. Try double-clicking the setup script again
